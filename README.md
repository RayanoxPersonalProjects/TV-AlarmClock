# TV-AlarmClock
An electronic project to build a programmable hardware that will be able to be connected with one or several kind of remote controls (like a PlasyStation Controller, a TV remote control, etc.). The first goal here is to build a TV alarm clock, it means that the built electronic circuit must be able to be configured and activated before you go sleeping, and then it will wake you up at time by switching on your TV device and using your Playstation (4) controller to open Youtube and go watch a video based on the research terms you already program into the Microcontroller.
